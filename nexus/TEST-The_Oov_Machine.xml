  Travel only with thy equals or thy betters; if there are none, travel alone.

    Bah!
    None of us are traveling alone -     
  </beat>
  <beat>
  	Gaia is spinning - she does a little dance for us all.
  </beat>
  <beat>
  	The ones who know this try to keep time - 
  </beat>
  <beat>
  	and try to dance.
  </beat>
  <beat>
    The dervishes know this in their bones
    and dance    
  </beat>
  <beat>
  	and are dizzy with her.
  </beat>  
  <beat>
    Scientists know this to the nanosecond
    and dance    
  </beat>
  <beat>
  	and are dizzy with her.
  </beat>
  <beat>
    You hear this now but may not know this.  
  </beat>
  <beat>
    You can never dance
  </beat>
  <beat>
    until you know this.    
  </beat>
  <beat>
	You hear this now but may not know this,   
  </beat>
  <beat>
  	and until you know this     	
  </beat>
  <beat>
  	you will probably, sadly, be...
  </beat>
  <beat>
  	merely 
  </beat>
  <beat>
  	sick..    
  </beat>
  <beat>
  	for now...
  </beat>
  <beat>
    We are all in the same ball
    falling through the universe, 
    missing an imaginary ground.
  </beat>  
  <beat>
    There is a rhythm to it,
  </beat>
  <beat>
  	as relentless and musical 
  </beat>
  <beat>
  	as the weighing of an anchor.
  </beat>  
  <beat>
    Listen! Not to the slamming, 
    not to the anchors, 
    not to the chains, 
  </beat>
  <beat>
  	but to the bubbles...and the rumbles...  	
  </beat>
  <beat>
    Those...are convector howlers,     
  </beat>
  <beat>
  	they are the base...
  	that creates the lather   
  </beat>
  <beat>
  	with which we bathe the future,   
  </beat>
  <beat>
  	with which we build the rhythm
  </beat>
  <beat>
   that makes our universe dance...
  </beat>
  <beat>
   and makes our little star dance...
  </beat>
  <beat>
   and makes our little world dance
  </beat>
  <beat>
    and makes the ones who know this...
  </beat>
  <beat>
  	dance.
  </beat>  
  <beat>
    Remember, ignorant one, 
    listen to them - the convector howlers - 
  </beat>
  <beat>
    they will take you places.
  </beat>
  <beat>
  	Remember, fool:
  </beat>
  <beat>
    They matter,
  </beat>
  <beat>
  	as do you.
  </beat>
  <beat>
    Now do you know this?
  </beat>
  <beat>
    Then try to dance.  
  </beat>
