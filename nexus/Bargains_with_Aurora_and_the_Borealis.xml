	Dearest Aurora,
	</beat>
	<beat>
	You are very faint at this distance,
	and I have given up my eyes.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	There are parts of you 
	that sparkle in the spectrum
	I live in now,
	</beat>
	<beat>
	but there were always 
	parts of you that sparkled.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	I have never needed - 
	and do not need -
	to see in the radio spectrum
	to notice this
	</beat>
	<beat>
	or to know this.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	Hush. 
	Hush.
	Hush.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	Even with the lag,
	I can still feel you,
	I can still hear you.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	What you look like in that narrow band is still available,  
	as a simulation, 
	running on lovely software - 
	so I can still smell you...
	I can still hear you.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	Hush.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	Hush.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	Hush.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	I behold you between the data.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	I can hear the auroras howl...
	</beat>
	<beat>
	and the pulse of your heart...
	</beat>
	<beat>
	and Jupiter's jazz.
	I can buck-dance to the beat of a pulsar,
	</beat>
	<beat>
	and slow-drag to the gentle circuit
	of your embrace.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	Yes, though my eyes are something else,
	</beat>
	<beat>
	Yes, though my eyes are elsewhere,
	</beat>
	<beat>
	I know the most brilliant Aurora 
	is waiting for me -
	shining and swaying 
	in a small house for me.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	I will be there.
	I will come back.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	I have so much to show you, 
	my dearest Aurora,
	</beat>
	<beat>
	dearest Aurora.
	</beat>
