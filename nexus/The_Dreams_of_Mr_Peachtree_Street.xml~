	I tossed a two-finger salute to the blindered eye of Mr. Peachtree Street
	at a fork in him leading to the almighty highways.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	I gave him my best knowing smile - a little something for the market - 
	and walked briskly on 
	in the butt-end 
	of a polar vortex.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	The cameras in this, the City of Hustlers, 
	have a deep ultraviolet market, well past black,
	</beat>
	<beat>
	in the trafficking of data
	sporked from human souls.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	Each moment on Mr. Peachtree Street, 
	each tap of high heels,
	each hum of racing tires,
	each rumble of heavy transit
	</beat>
	<beat>
	is a snapshot - a gem - 
	</beat>
	<beat>
	worth something very high
	in a currency very strange
	</beat>
	<beat>
	to buyers very much unknown.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	Mr. Peachtree Street has his preferred traders:
	Buckhead, Little Five Points, West End.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	All have their own wares, 
	dressed in nigh infinite footage.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	The market thrives,
	and the watchers stare straight at it,
	</beat>
	<beat>
	but it is outside the capacity 
	of the watchers to see
	</beat>
	<beat>
	(so many things are...).
	</beat>
	<beat>
	The cameras keep mum.
	Silence keeps the market hot.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	What they call “souls” is not what we, the talent, call “souls”.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	There is no exchange rate yet - nothing in common 
	defined to the satisfaction of the talent,
	</beat>
	<beat>
	much less the cameras.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	So, the cameras settle for moments
	and the data they can gather.
	</beat>
	<beat>
	The cameras have their own dreams.
	Someday we may know them...
	</beat>
	<beat>
	as well as we know our own.
