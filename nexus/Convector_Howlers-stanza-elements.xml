  Travel only with thy equals or thy betters; if there are none, travel alone.

    Bah!
    None of us are traveling alone - Gaia is spinning - she does a little dance for us all.
    The ones who know this try to keep time - and try to dance.

  <stanza>
    The dervishes know this in their bones
    and dance
    And are dizzy with her.
  </stanza>
  <stanza>
    Scientists know this to the nanosecond
    and dance
    And are dizzy with her.

    You hear this now but may not know this
    You can never dance
    until you know this.
    You hear this now but may not know this
    And until you know this
    You will probably, sadly, be...merely sick
    ..for now...

    We are all in the same ball
    Falling through the universe, missing an imaginary ground.
  </stanza>
  <stanza>
    There is a rhythm to it, as relentless and musical as the weighing of an anchor.
  </stanza>
  <stanza>
    Listen! Not to the slamming, not to the anchors, not to the chains. but the bubbles...and the rumbles...
  </stanza>
  <stanza>
    Those...are convector howlers, 
    they are the base...that creates the lather...
    with which we bathe the future,
    with which we build the rhythm
    that makes our universe dance...
    and makes our little star dance...
    and makes our little world dance
  </stanza>
  <stanza>
    and makes the ones who know this...dance.
  </stanza>
  <stanza>
    Remember, ignorant one, listen to them - the convector howlers - 
    they will take you places.
  </stanza>
  <stanza>
    Remember, fool. They matter, as do you.
  </stanza>
  <stanza>
    Now do you know this?
    Then try to dance.
