  I watched my great, great grandchildren
  sink into the earth - 
  and I cried,
  and I cried,
  and I cried.
  </beat>
  <beat>
  I watched my great, great grandchildren
  smiling and leaning to the left
  as they descended into the bio/techno/mycosphere -
  </beat>
  <beat>
  the grey and the green and the gooey
  of the newly networked earth -
  </beat>
  <beat>
  and I cried,
  and I cried,
  and I cried.
  </beat>
  <beat>
  “I cannot go with you - 
  I don’t have the filaments.
  I cannot understand.”
  </beat>
  <beat>
  They sent me a text message,
  ancient and quaint,
  saying,
  </beat>
  <beat>
  -Don’t cry Poppy - 
  - We are alive (oh, so alive) -
  - growing and wading deep, deep down -
  - into Fungitown. -
  </beat>
  <beat>
  - There is work to do here, -
  - deep, deep down in Fungitown, -
  - and we would take you, too, -
  - deep, deep down into Fungitown, -
  - but you cannot go. -
  </beat>
  <beat>
  - You know this, right Poppy? -
  - It is not meant to be. -
  </beat>
  <beat>
  - I know this -, I text back 
  (my thumbs ache, my joints crack...
  I don’t have the filaments).
  </beat>
  <beat>
  I can only see the wake of their movements, 
  translated by software two generations younger than me
  that (I barely understand | I cannot understand).
  </beat>
  <beat>
  Perhaps someday I may, 
  when my flesh decays
  or my metal winds down.
  </beat>
  <beat>
  - Won’t you take me? - I ask.
  </beat>
  <beat>
  - Down to Fungitown? -
  - Sorry, Poppy, you’re not “fungi” enough -
  </beat>
  <beat>
  What’s left of them coughs up spores as they laugh.
  I chuckle as I cough.
  </beat>
  <beat>
  - Put your mask on, Poppy -
  </beat>
  <beat>
  “What are you doing down there?” I speak to their sinking bodies.
  “What are you building? 
  Are you eating?
  Are you being eaten?
  What ARE you?”
  </beat>
  <beat>
  More spores, and then the texts:
  </beat>
  <beat>
  - You wouldn’t believe us if we told you. -
  </beat>
  <beat>
  - Put your mask on, Poppy. You can’t take much more of this. -
  - Watch your texts, Poppy. We’ll see you. We will. -
  - Not soon, but you will see us. -
  - You will. -
  </beat>
  <beat>
  - Until then, Poppy...live longer. -
  - You will see us. Live longer. -
  </beat>
  <beat>
  I watered my great, great grandchildren
  when they sank into the earth -
  </beat>
  <beat>
  and I cried,
  and I cried,
  and I cried - 
  </beat>
  <beat>
  not because they had died,
  </beat>
  <beat>
  but out of pride.
  </beat>
  <beat>
  Some day,
  some thing -
  </beat>
  <beat>
  some amazing, familiar,
  and oh, please, beautiful thing
  </beat>
  <beat>
  will grow there.
  </beat>
  <beat>
  I know this.
  I know this.
  I know this.
  </beat>
